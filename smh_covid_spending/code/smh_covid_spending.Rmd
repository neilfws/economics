# Introduction

An attempt to improve the maps used in the Sydney Morning Herald article [Sydney's wealthiest tightened their belts during lockdown. Now they are spending again](https://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/sydney-s-wealthiest-tightened-their-belts-during-lockdown-now-they-are-spending-again-20201201-p56jn1.html).

The maps in this article have several problems:

- poor choice of colour palette doesn't distinguish values over a wide range
- lack of contrast due to transparency values
- difficult to compare before/after values as zoom level is not maintained when switching tabs

# Data
The underlying data for the maps in the SMH article is stored as a large JSON string in the web page source. With some effort this can be copy-pasted to an editor, checked and cleaned up using JSON Lint and saved as the file `smh.json`.

We can read the file using `jsonlite::fromJSON`, which results in a large and complex data structure. The relevant elements can be extracted as vectors and stored in tibble columns.


```{r read-json}
smh <- fromJSON("../data/smh.json")

smh_df <- tibble(
  lga_code = smh$elements$data[[3]][, , 1][1,],
  lga_name = smh$elements$data[[3]][, , 5][1,],
  coords   = smh$elements$data[[3]][, , 4][1,],
  before   = smh$elements$data[[3]][, , 2][1,],
  after    = smh$elements$data[[3]][, , 2][2,]
)
```

For maps of NSW local government areas, we use the shapefile `LGA_2019_AUST.shp` available online and reused from a previous project.

```{r read-shp}
lga <- readOGR("../../../health/covid19/nsw_covid/data/1270055003_lga_2019_aust_shp/LGA_2019_AUST.shp")
```

## Data pre-processing
For the SMH article data:

-convert numbers stored as character to numeric.
- at least one LGA name (Sydney) occurs twice, so group and keep the first instance
- finally, convert LGA names to lower-case for easier matching
    - for example we have Ku-Ring-Gai in one dataset and Ku-ring-gai in the other

```{r process-data}
smh_df <- smh_df %>% 
  mutate(before = as.numeric(before), 
         after  = as.numeric(after), 
         diff   = after - before) %>% 
  group_by(lga_name) %>% 
  slice(1) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(lga_name = tolower(lga_name))
```

For the shapefile data:

- remove the electoral ward letters _e.g._ `(A)` from LGA names
- remove the one instance of " NSW" as a suffix
- convert LGA names to lower-case

```{r process-shp}
nsw <- subset(lga, STE_CODE16 == 1)
nsw@data <- nsw@data %>% 
  mutate(LGA_NAME19_new = str_remove_all(LGA_NAME19, "\\s\\([A-Z]+\\)"),
         LGA_NAME19_new = str_remove_all(LGA_NAME19_new, "\\sNSW"),
         LGA_NAME19_new = tolower(LGA_NAME19_new))
```

Now we can successfully join the SMH article data to the shapefile data.

```{r join-data}
nsw@data <- nsw@data %>% 
  left_join(smh_df, 
            by = c("LGA_NAME19_new" = "lga_name"))

nsw@data %>% 
  head(10) %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "condensed"))
```

# Maps

## Before map
Colour the LGAs by lockdown period average spend per person as percentage of normal.

```{r map-before-data, echo=FALSE}
pal <- colorNumeric(
  palette = "plasma",
  domain = nsw@data$before,
  na.color = "#ffffff"
)

nsw_map <- leaflet() %>% 
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) %>% 
  addPolygons(data = nsw,
              weight = 1,
              fillOpacity = 0.5,
              label = ~paste(LGA_NAME19_new, " = ", before),
              fillColor = ~pal(before)) %>% 
  addLegend("bottomright",
            title = "Lockdown spend % of normal",
            pal = pal,
            values = smh_df$before,
            na.label = "")

nsw_map
```

## After map
Colour the LGAs by post-lockdown period (September-October 2020) average spend per person as percentage of normal.

```{r map-after-data, echo=FALSE}
pal <- colorNumeric(
  palette = "plasma",
  domain = nsw@data$after,
  na.color = "#ffffff"
)

nsw_map <- leaflet() %>% 
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) %>% 
  addPolygons(data = nsw,
              weight = 1,
              fillOpacity = 0.5,
              label = ~paste(LGA_NAME19_new, " = ", after),
              fillColor = ~pal(after)) %>% 
  addLegend("bottomright",
            title = "Sep-Oct 2020 spend % of normal",
            pal = pal,
            values = smh_df$after,
            na.label = "")

nsw_map
```

## Difference map
Colour the LGAs by difference in percentage points "after" (September-October 2020) minus "before" (lockdown period).

```{r map-diff-data, echo=FALSE}
pal <- colorNumeric(
  palette = "plasma",
  domain = nsw@data$diff,
  na.color = "#ffffff"
)

nsw_map <- leaflet() %>% 
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) %>% 
  addPolygons(data = nsw,
              weight = 1,
              fillOpacity = 0.5,
              label = ~paste(LGA_NAME19_new, " = ", diff),
              fillColor = ~pal(diff)) %>% 
  addLegend("bottomright",
            title = "Differential spend after % - before %",
            pal = pal,
            values = smh_df$diff,
            na.label = "")

nsw_map
```
